## 1) Introduction: What you picked and What is it ?
I Choose to build an app called activityTransition, it is a modern style of application that helps us to convert one state to another state in the form of animations. I incorporated various effects in this app , which can be performed on the main app. Today, various developments in the field of application is carried out , so I decided to have this project for our knowledge development about the various forms of animations, that an app can perform.

## 2) What does it do?

It is an application , which features currently basic animation styles , such as on/off style.It allows the users with a much more fun and animated way to enjoy their images. This basically provides some sort of feelings to the user about using the switch ON and OFF of flashlight that he/she normally do at in their PC and mobile screen.

## 3)steps to make it work or to use it in my project

The basic steps that were involved in making the project is as follows:
<p> i) I created a xml layout of the app , that finds appealing to the user, with the help of android studio.</p>
<p> ii) I had upload the images at drawable to fit to its size and perform such ON and OFF animations.(few of the codes of the animation are mentioned bellow)</p>
